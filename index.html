        <h2>
          Joey has gone walkabout. Can you help him find his way back to his mum
          and sister?
        </h2>
        <h3>How to play?</h3>
        <p>
          Using your arrow keys (←, ↑, →, ↓) help Joey reunite with his family
          Navigate Joey past the dingoes, use the log to get across the
          billabong and dodge the incoming traffic of pick up trucks. Be
          careful! If Joey collides with an obstacle or falls into the
          billabong, he'll lose a life and be returned to the start. Joey starts
          with eight lives. And don't forget each step closer to his family
          earns you an extra 100points with another 400points when Joey returns
          to his family. Press “start” and help Joey find his family.
