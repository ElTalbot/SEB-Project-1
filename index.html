        <h2>
          Joey has gone walkabout. Can you help him find his way back to his mum
          and sister?
        </h2>
        <h3>How to play?</h3>
        <p>
          Using your arrow keys <span class="
          arrows">(←, ↑, →, ↓)</span> help Joey reunite with his family. <br>
          Navigate Joey past the dingoes, use the log to get across the
          billabong and dodge the incoming traffic of pick up trucks.
          <p>Be careful! If Joey collides with an obstacle or falls into the
          billabong, he'll lose a life and be returned to the start. </p>
          <p>Joey starts with <span class="arrows">8</span> lives. <br>And don't forget make sure Joey gets a chance to snack along the way to earn you an extra <span class="arrows">100points</span>
          <p>Press “start” and help Joey find his family.</p>
        </p>
